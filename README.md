## Next.js Pet-Project

### Start:
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Lint:
```
pnpm lint
```

### Comments
 * Styles has a lot of `!important` strings. This is bad practice, but it's the fastest way to prorotype with `antd`.
 * `getCharacter` API call implemented with a little overhead due to lack of information to draw in the single `Character` instance
